    ## About Lori Schmon


    I am a filmmaker and producer with a passion for creative non-fiction storytelling. I have eight years of experience directing and producing videos for Vevo, MTV, and various corporations/universities.


    I first began my storytelling journey as a bright-eyed teen with a love for video cameras and editing. Soon enough, that passion developed into something much deeper and personal: I wanted to understand people and tell their stories in hopes of revealing truth about the world we live in today. The more we can connect with people from all walks of life — from different societies, cultures and religions — the more we’ll begin to understand each other and have more compassion.
overview:
  title: "I am currently directing a documentary about the Jordanian women's
    soccer team and their quest to qualify for the Women's World Cup. "
  content: With this film and all of my future films, my aim is to wade through
    the streams of human emotion, however difficult and challenging it might be,
    and tell stories that make people feel something.
